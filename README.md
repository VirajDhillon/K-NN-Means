# K-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier
•	Able to classify individual data points of Iris flowers as one of three Iris flower species/classes based on the other data points (neighbors) close to the original data point. 

•	Depending on the amount of neighbors, ranging from 1 to 8, to base the classification on, the average accuracy for this classification was around 95%-96%. 

•	Use of Numpy and other Python libraries to help visualize this model.
